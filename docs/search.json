They are both true color images (TCI) with the Red, Green and Blue bands present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel-2 (left) and Landsat-8 (Right) TCI over Bucharest (October 2022)\n\n\n\n We have a more recent view available of the Landsat imagery (24th of October) but prefer not to use it as more impurities are present. We will tackle this in future Diary entries with the introduction of atmospheric correction.\n\n\n\n\n\nRBG image of most recent image, not used in examples\n\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to explore our data by looking at the different colour composites in the sentinel images:\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Penetration Composite (left), False Colour Composite (Middle), 100% pixel display (right)"
