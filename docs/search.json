    "text": "2.1 Basic Raster image processing and statistics\nOur images presented below, were collected on the 27th and 17th of October 2022 for Sentinel and Landsat respectively. They are both true color images (TCI) with the Red, Green and Blue bands present.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel-2 (left) and Landsat-8 (Right) TCI over Bucharest (October 2022)\n\n\n\n We have a more recent view available of the Landsat imagery (24th of October) but prefer not to use it as more impurities are present. We will tackle this in future Diary entries with the introduction of atmospheric correction.\n\n\n\n\n\nRBG image of most recent image, not used in examples\n\n\n\n\n\nWe continue to explore our data by looking at the different colour composites in the sentinel images:\n\n\n\n\n\nAtmospheric Penetration (left), False Colour Infrared (Middle), B1 band (right)\n\n\n\n\nIs it interesting to try and understand what the colours mean in these images. For example, the middle image, False Colour Composite (using bands B8, B4 and B3) aims to show the physiography of the terrain showing soil and land-resources which has been common practice since the 20th century (Reddy et al. (1990)). As our study area is primarily urban (Bucharest located in the bottom-left corner), we see that many of the red colours bands are absorbed, signifying a lack of vegetation in the Capital, compared to rural areas on the right side of the image.\nThe same is true for the left image, the atmospheric penetration, where we recognise distinct urban areas due to the purple/gray cyan colours in the bottom-left corner. Finally, the right side image provides a raw overview of the sentinel imagery, and specifically the B1 band. the B1 band is used for the Coastal and Aerosol information, with a detailed description of Bands available here!"

    "text": "2.2 Understanding the differences between Sentinel 2 and Landsat\nNow that we have images from both sources, we proceed to resample the images to the same resolution. Below we have a comparison of the bands between Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8.\n\n\n\nComparison of Sentinel and Landsat Bands, taken from López-Puigdollers, Mateo-García, and Gómez-Chova (2021)\n\n\nYet this is not enough as in order to make cross-platform comparisons successful! Below we have a detailed overview comparing band resolution between Sentinel and Landsat, with respective links to sources of Table 1 (left) and Table 2 (right)!\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel-2 (left) and Landsat-8 (right) band comparisons\n\n\n\nWe see that the two platforms share certain similar characteristics, but differences are notable. For example, even if the Blue, Green and Red Channels are present on both, their wavelengths do not overlap perfectly. Furthermore, both platforms do not have all the same bands, with 1,2,3,4 overlapping similarly and B11 and B12 on S-2 working with B6 and B7 on L-8. In our application today, we will only be using Bands 2 to 4 on both, B6 and 7 on Landsat and B8 and 12 on Sentinel.\nMost importantly, these two platforms do not share the same resolutions, with L-8 principally outputting at 30m compared to S-2 between 10, 20 or 60m.\nTo overcome this, we upscale the Sentinel Imagery to Fit the 30m resolution displayed by Landsat. As we decide to focus on Bucharest specifically, we also subset the image to only the city outline using shapefiles provided by GADM. The clipped results are as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nSentinel-2 (left) and Landsat-8 (right) clipped RBG images of Bucharest (at same resolution)"
