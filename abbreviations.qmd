# Abbreviations Used in this Book!

As remote sensing can get quite complex in terms of nomenclature, this Appreviation can come in handy when potential concept explenations are not clear!

-   **RBG** : Red, Blue Green

-   **TOA** : Top of Atmosphere

-   **L-8** : Landsat-8 Satellite

-   **S-2** : Sentinel-2

-   **GEE** : Google Earth Engine

-   **SNAP** : Sentinel Application Platform is provided by the ESA/ESRIN and allows the Earth Observation Community with a free tool to process and analyse satellite imagery. It has the advantage of providing InSAR Processing capabilities, [which is not yet the case with GEE](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/348182/does-google-earth-engine-have-insar-processing-capabilities-for-sentinel-1-data#:~:text=The%20answer%20is%20no.,flexible%20python%2Dbased%20InSAR%20toolboxes)

-   **POI** : Points of Interest - these are points that are representative of certain land-cover types and allows for comparison between platforms. This was for example used in the [Bucharest Analysis](https://vtesniere.github.io/CASA0023_book/intro.html#Selecting-our-Points-of-Interest) where we used reference area for water, green area and industrial area to compare L-8 and S-2 imagery.

-   **ESA** : European Space Agency

-   **ESRIN** : ESA center for earth Observation created in 1966 and currently based in Frascati, Italy

-   **SWIR** : Short-wave infrared, part of the electromagnetic spectrum and allows for identification of objects invisible to the human eye and traditional multi-spectral bands. It can allow for the identification of certain terrain characteristics (i.e. certain bands in SWIR is more highly absorbed by water bodies). Ranges from 1.4 to 3 Âµm (micrometers)
