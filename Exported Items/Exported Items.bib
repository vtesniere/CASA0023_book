	abstract = {We summarize the sixth data mining competition organized at the Knowledge Pit platform in association with the Federated Conference on Computer Science and Information Systems series, titled Clash Royale Challenge: How to Select Training Decks for Win-rate Prediction. We outline the scope of this challenge and briefly present its results. We also discuss the problem of acquiring knowledge about new notions from video games through an active learning cycle. We explain how this task is related to the problem considered in the challenge and share results of experiments that we conducted to demonstrate usefulness of the active learning approach in practice.},
